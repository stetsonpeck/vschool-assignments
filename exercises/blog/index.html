        <p class="l1">My Maria don't you know I've come a long, long way I been longin' to see her When she's around she takes my blues away Sweet Maria the sunlight surely hurts my eyes I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies Maria, (Oh Maria I love you girl, oh my Maria) Maria, (Oh Maria I love you girl, Maria) I love you My Maria there were some blue and sorrow times Just my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind Gypsy lady you're a miracle work for me You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea She is the sunlight when skies are gray She treats me so right lady take me away</p>
